        <ul>
          <li>Regression/Estimation:</li>
            <p>It's used for predicting a continuos value, for example, the price of a house based on its characteristics</p>
          <li>Clasification:</li>

          <li>Association:</li>

          <li>Anomaly Detection:</li>
            <p>It's used for discovering abnormal and unsual cases. for example, credit card fraud detection</p>
          <li>Sequence Mining:</li>
            <p>It's used for predicting next events, for example, the click stream in web sites</p>
          <li>Dimension Reduction:</li>
            <p>It's used for reducing the size of data</p>
          <li>Recommendation Systems:</li>
            <p>It's used for associate different tastes or preferences of persons and then recommend new items they might like</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <h4 class="text-center">Supervised learning</h4>
            <p>We observe and direct the execution of a task, project or activity. We'll be supervising a machine learnign model by teaching it
            by loading it with necessary knowledge, so we can have a predict on the future. We train the model with some data from a labeled dataset.
            It's important to note that the dataset is labeled and the enviroment is very controlled by us. There are two kinds of supervising models: CLASSIFICATION AND REGRESSION</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <h4 class="text-center">Unsupervised learning</h4>
            <p>We don't supervise the model, but we let the model work on his own to discover information that is not visible for the human eye.
            Since we know little information about the data or the outcomes that are to be expected, it has more difficult algorithms.
            It's important to note that here we deal with unlabeled dataset of information and our task is to classify or to cluster it. By the way,
            the enviroment we work on is very less controlled. The most widely used techniques are: DIMENSION REDUCTION, DENSITY ESTIMATION,
            MARKET BASKET ANALYSIS AND CLUSTERING</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Regression</h2>
        <p>It has two kind of variables: Dependent and independent variable. The dependent variable is the goal we try to predict, and the independent variable (can be one or more)
        is the cause of the dependent variable. Basiclly there are two types of regression models:</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <h4 class="text-center">Simple Regression</h4>
            <p>It's when ONE independent variable is used to estimate one dependent variable. It can be:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Simple Linear Regression</li>

          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <h4 class="text-center">Multiple Regression</h4>
            <p>It's when ONE OR MORE independents variables are used to estimate one dependent variable. It can be:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Multiple Linear Regression</li>
              <li>Multiple Non-Linear Regression</li>

        <h2 class="text-center">Model Evaluation in Regression Models</h2>
        <p>The most widely used evaluation models are: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Train and Test on the same data set</li>
            <p>Due to test with training data, it produces a high training accuracy but this is not necessarily a good thing. It may be over-fit and a non-generalized model
            By the way this produces a low out-of-sample accuracy</p>
          <li>Train and Test Split</li>
            <p>Due to test with non-training data, it produces a higher out-of-sample accuracy wich is what we want.
            The problem with this model is a high dependency on wich datasets the data is trained and tested.</p>
          <li>K-fold Cross-validation</li>
            <p>It performs multiple Train and Test split evaluations and average the results. Then the total result is a more consistent out-of-sample accuracy</p>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-center">Evaluation Metrics in Regression Models</h2>
        <p>In the regression model, an error consists on the meassure of how far the data points are from the trend line generated by the algorithm.</p>
        <p>The most widely used evaluation metrics are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mean Absolute Error</li>
          <li>Mean Squared Error</li>
          <li>Root Mean Squared Error</li>
          <li>Relative Absolute Error</li>
          <li>Relative Squared Error</li>
          <li>R^2 = 1 - RSE</li>
            <p>This is not an error but is a popular metric for the accuracy of the model. The higher R-squared, the higher the model fits the data</p>
